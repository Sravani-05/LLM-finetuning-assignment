# LLM-finetuning-assignment

a) Simple Agents assignment

In this colab I have built python agents and have demonstrated multiple backend tools (use chatgpt to write the backends to various tools) - provide more tools than the hint as well as an outer loop.

d) Use QLora to finetune a model. generate custom data set.

I have generated a custom dataset for mental healthcare using multiple Books, PDFs on mental health and using GPT4.

e) Use mistral llm with RAG and demonstrate a production usecase.

Built a mental health related basic question anwering chatbot which helps user with their mental healthcare.

g) Quantize llm with ggml and gguf and build an end2end chat application on mobile phone and load the model and demonstrate using MLC end2end.
